## Package overview

**visOmopResults** offers a set of functions tailored to format objects of class  `<summarised_result>` (as defined in [omopgenerics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=omopgenerics) package). 

It provides functionality to: **transform** data, create **table** visualizations, and generate **plot** visualizations. These visualizations are highly versatile for reporting results through Shiny apps, RMarkdown, Quarto, and more, supporting various output formats such as HTML, PNG, Word, and PDF.

## Let's get started

You can install the latest version of visOmopResults from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("visOmopResults")
```

Or you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/darwin-eu/visOmopResults) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("darwin-eu/visOmopResults")
```

The `<summarised_result>` is a standardised output format utilized across various packages, including:

- [CohortCharacteristics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CohortCharacteristics)
- [DrugUtilisation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DrugUtilisation)
- [IncidencePrevalence](https://cran.r-project.org/package=IncidencePrevalence)
- [PatientProfiles](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PatientProfiles)
- [CodelistGenerator](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CodelistGenerator)
- [CohortSurvival](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CohortSurvival)
- [CohortSymmetry](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CohortSymmetry)

Although this standard output format is essential, it can sometimes be challenging to manage. The *visOmopResults* package aims to simplify this process. To demonstrate the package's functionality, let's start by using some mock result:

```{r}
library(visOmopResults)
result <- mockSummarisedResult()
```

## Transformation of a `<summarised_result>` object

A tidy version of the summarised can be obtained with the tidy function:
```{r}
tidy(result)
```

This tidy format is no longer standardized but offers easier manipulation. While `tidy()` provides a straightforward transformation, the more customizable sibling function `tidySummarisedResult()` allows you to specify exactly how you'd like to tidy your `<summarised_result>` object:

```{r}
result |>
  tidySummarisedResult(
    splitStrata = FALSE,
    settingsColumns = "package_name", 
    pivotEstimatesBy = NULL
  )
```

## Filter a `<summarised_result>` object

A `<summarised_result>` object is essentially a `<data.frame>`, so it can be filtered easily using `dplyr::filter()`. However, filtering variables within name-level structures or those present in the settings can be challenging. The following functions simplify this process:

- `filterSettings()`
- `filterGroup()`
- `filterStrata()`
- `filterAdditional()`

Here are some examples on how to use them:

```{r}
result |>
  filterSettings(package_name == "visOmopResults")
```

```{r}
result |>
  filterSettings(package_name == "other")
```

```{r}
result |>
  filterStrata(sex == "Female")
```

## Tables visualisations

Currently all table functionalities are built around 3 packages: [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble), [gt](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gt), and [flextable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flextable).

There are two main functions:

- `visOmopTable()`: Creates a well-formatted table specifically from a `<summarised_result>` object.
- `visTable()`: Creates a nicely formatted table from any `<data.frame>` object.

Let's see a simple example:
```{r}
result |>
  visOmopTable(
    type = "flextable", # to change to gt when issue 223 is fixed
    estimateName = c(
      "N(%)" = "<count> (<percentage>%)", 
      "N" = "<count>", 
      "mean (sd)" = "<mean> (<sd>)"),
    header = c("sex"),
    settingsColumns = NULL,
    groupColumn = c("cohort_name", "age_group"),
    rename = c("Variable" = "variable_name", " " = "variable_level"),
    hide = "cdm_name"
  )
```

## Plots visualisations

Currently all plot functionalities are built around [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2). The output of these plot functions is a `<ggplot2>` object that can be further customised.

There are three plotting functions:

- `plotScatter()` to create a scatter plot.
- `plotBar()` to create a bar plot.
- `plotBox()` to create a box plot.

Let's see how we can create a simple boxplot for age using this tool:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
result |>
  filter(variable_name == "number subjects") |>
  filterStrata(sex != "overall") |>
  barPlot(x = "age_group", 
          y = "count",
          facet = "cohort_name", 
          colour = "sex")
```
