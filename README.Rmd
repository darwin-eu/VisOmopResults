## Package overview

**visOmopResults** contains functions to format objects of the class *<summarised_result>* (as defined in [omopgenerics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=omopgenerics)). 

It provides functionality to: **transform**, **create table visualisations** and **create plot visualisations**. These visualisatoins can be very useful to report results via Shiny apps, RMarkdown, Quarto, and more; as they allow multiple formating outputs: html, png, word, pdf, ...

## Let's get started

You can install the latest version of visOmopResults from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("visOmopResults")
```

Or you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/darwin-eu/visOmopResults) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("darwin-eu/visOmopResults")
```

As mentioned before the *<summarised_result>* object is defined in omopgenerics and can be created with `omopgenerics::newSummarisedResult()`. This standardised output is used in many other packages such as:

- [CohortCharacteristics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CohortCharacteristics)
- [DrugUtilisation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DrugUtilisation)
- [IncidencePrevalence](https://cran.r-project.org/package=IncidencePrevalence)
- [PatientProfiles](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PatientProfiles)
- [CodelistGenerator](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CodelistGenerator)
- [CohortSurvival](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CohortSurvival)
- [CohortSymmetry](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CohortSymmetry)
- [omopSketch](https://cran.r-project.org/package=omopSketch)
- [PhenotypeR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PhenotypeR)

Although standard output is needed it can be hard to manage some times. The purpose of this package is to make it easier to manage. To show the different functionality we will use some mock data:

```{r}
library(visOmopResults)
result <- mockSummarisedResult()
```

## Transformation of a *<summarised_result>* object

A tidy version of the summarised can be obtained with the tidy function:
```{r}
tidy(result)
```

Note that tidy format is not standardised any more but it makes easier to manipulate. The `tidy()` function does not have any customisation function, but a sibling function is `tidySummarisedResult()` that provides all custom functionality to specify how you want to tidy your *<summarised_result>* object.
```{r}
result |>
  tidySummarisedResult(
    splitStrata = FALSE,
    settingsColumns = "package_name", 
    pivotEstimatesBy = NULL
  )
```

## Filter a *<summarised_result>* object

A *<summarised_result>* object is a *<data.frame>* so it can easily be filtered using the `dplyr::filter()` function, but some times it can be quite challenging to filter variables that are joined in a name-level structure or are present in the settings of the analysis. The functions:

- `filterSettings()`
- `filterGroup()`
- `filterStrata()`
- `filterAdditional()`

can help to do that:

```{r}
result |>
  filterSettings(package_name == "visOmopResults")
```

```{r}
result |>
  filterSettings(package_name == "other")
```

```{r}
result |>
  filterStrata(sex == "Female")
```

## Tables visualisations

Currently all table functionalities are built around 3 packages: [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble), [gt](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gt), and [flextable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flextable).

There exist two main functions:

- `visOmopTable()` used to create a nice table from a *<summarised_result>* object.
- `visTable()` used to create a nice table from a *<data.frame>* object.

Let's see a simple example:
```{r}
result |>
  visOmopTable(
    type = "flextable", # to change to gt when issue 223 is fixed
    estimateName = c(
      "N(%)" = "<count> (<percentage>%)", 
      "N" = "<count>", 
      "mean (sd)" = "<mean> (<sd>)"),
    header = c("sex"),
    settingsColumns = NULL,
    groupColumn = c("cohort_name", "age_group"),
    rename = c("Variable" = "variable_name", " " = "variable_level"),
    hide = "cdm_name"
  )
```

## Plots visualisations

Currently all plot functionalities are built around [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2). The output of these plot functions is a *<ggplot2>* object that can be further customised.

There are three plotting functions:

- `plotScatter()` to create a scatter plot.
- `plotBar()` to create a bar plot.
- `plotBox()` to create a box plot.

Let's see how we can create a simple boxplot for age using this tool:

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
result |>
  filter(variable_name == "number subjects") |>
  filterStrata(sex != "overall") |>
  barPlot(x = "age_group", 
          y = "count",
          facet = "cohort_name", 
          colour = "sex")
```
