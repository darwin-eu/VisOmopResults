## Background

Dealing with an *<summarised_result>* object can be difficult to handle specially when we are trying to filter. For example, difficult tasks would be to filter to a certain result_type or when there are many strata joined together filter only one of the variables. On the other hand it exists the [tidy](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/articles/tidy.html) format that makes it easy to filter, but then you loose the *<summarised_result>* object. There exist some functions that only work with *<summarised_result>* objects.

**visOmopResults** package contains some functionalities that helps on this process:

- `filterSettings` to filter the *<summarised_result>* object using the `settings()` attribute.
- `filterStrata` to filter the *<summarised_result>* object using the strata_name-starta_level version   attribute.
